# PR- 5(HERITAGE)


<u>**Aim 1**</u> :Write a program that defines a shape class with a constructor that gives value to width and height. The define two sub classes triangle and rectangle, that calculate the area of the shape area (). In the main, define two variables a triangle and a rectangle and then call the area() function in this two varibles.

<u>**Program File**</u> : pr-5-1.cpp

<u>**Output**</u> :

<img src="" height = "200px" alt = "unable to load image.">

<u>**Aim 2**</u> :Write a program with a mother class and an inherited daugther class.Both of them should have a method void display ()that prints a message (different for mother and daugther). In the main define a daughter and call the display() method on it.

<u>**Program File**</u> : pr-5-2.cpp

<u>**Output**</u> :

<img src="" height = "200px" alt = "unable to load image.">

<u>**Aim 3**</u> :Write a program with a mother class animal. Inside it define a name and an age variables, and set_value() function. Then create two bases variables Zebra and Dolphin which write a message telling the age, the name and giving some extra information (e.g. place of origin).
