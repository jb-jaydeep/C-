<u>**Aim 1**</u> :  WAP to find sum of all three numbers cubes by implementing single level inheritance: Class X->Class Y.

- Class X has following members: a, b & c attributes in integer data type.
- Class Y has following members: setData() and getData() methods. 

<u>**Program File**</u> : ch-5-1-1.cpp

<u>**Output**</u> :

<u>**Aim 2**</u> :WAP to convert given degree celsius temperature into fahrenheit and convert that fahrenheit temperature into kelvin by implementing multilevel inheritance: Class P -> Class Q -> Class R.

- Class P has following members: temperature attribute in float.
- Class Q has following members: toFehrenheit() method.
- Class R has following members: toKelvin() method.
