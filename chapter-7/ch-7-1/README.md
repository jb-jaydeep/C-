# CHAPTER- 7.

## 7.1

<u>**Aim 1**</u> : Write a program to abstract some attributes of class Admin to
prevent them to be inherited by its child classes.

- Class Admin -> Class Manager
- Class Manager -> Class Employee
- Class Admin has following members:
- company_name
- manager_salary
- employee_salary
- total_staff
- total_annual_revenue
- can_terminate
- use all attributes accessibility in parent class and
child class properly.
- override a method myAccess() in both child
classes to display all parent classâ€™s members value
accordingly.
